## Usage

### Prerequisite

> Ensure to have NodeJS v6.x MINIMUM.

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### bundle dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### dev : hot reload mode

Development mode = best dev experience (_hot reload, redux devtools extension..._).

```bash
npm run start
```

> Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001)

### bundle production mode

```bash
npm run prod
```

### run production

In `Development` ReactJS is `not optimized at all` (_you may even find the application to be slow_).

_ReactJS shows its real power and is `amazing fast` when bundled in `production`._

_General case:_

```bash
npm run prod-server
```

> Then go to localhost:8081
